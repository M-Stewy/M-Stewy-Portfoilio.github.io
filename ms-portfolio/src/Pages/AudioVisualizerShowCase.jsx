    <h2>For my Creative Coding class CODS 356,
         I created an audio visualizer that recognizes the musical note being played,
          and displays the visual using nothing but said musical note

        I started with an idea of doing something with sound,
         and decided to try my hand at making an audio visualizer.
          I chose this as I thought it would be interesting to get some practice with
           understanding how utilizing a Fast Fourier Transform works to get the individual waveform amplitudes
            needed for the visualizer.
             I also decided to include the musical note being played for the display
